The following are issues known to us already and are planned to be resolved in the next release:

* The `initWithCoder:` and `encodeWithCoder:` methods are very boilerplatey and can easily be automated with a bit of runtime introspection.
* There is no way to build a search query without learning the syntax yourself. There should be an object-oriented way to build these up.
